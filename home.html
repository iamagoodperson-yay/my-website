        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a student at the School of Science of Technology, Singapore. I have done many projects, especially those related to coding. </p>

        <div class="about">
            <div>
                <h3>Fun facts about me:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I can speak 4 languages: English, Chinese, German, and Bahasa Indonesia (1 more and I'm a polygot!)</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>I like to listen to upbeat country music with a meaning behind the lyrics (especially from alec benjamin and Âë®Êù∞‰º¶) </li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A few projects I have worked on:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This website! (with some copying, but hey, every programmer copies sometimes)</li>
                    <li>Remindo, which was a team project in which I was the coder. It's an app for students to track their homework and give themselves notifications and reminders (if it sounds like basically every study app out there, I apologise, but I'm still proud of it)</li>
                    <!-- Remember to put at least 3 projects üôèüèº -->
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>My interests and hobbies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming, especially app development and website creation (kind of obvious based on the projects I showcased)</li>
                    <li>Procrastinating work by watching youtube, especially educational channels like Veritasium and Wendover Productions</li>
                    <li>In my free time, I enjoy vibing out to music. (shameless self promotion, but go check out Iamaperson on spotify, it has all the songs I like, because it's my account)</li>
                </ul>
